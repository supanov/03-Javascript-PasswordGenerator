# <Javascript Password Generator>

## Description

Our employer has asked to modify a starter code to create an application to random password generator to provide greater security. 

We will focus on the javascript on this project. Javascript converts a static web page to an interactive one and adds behavior to web pages. 

# Purpose

This activity aims to apply the concepts of javascript we learned in class to create a functional application for users. 

To apply and understand logical operaters is essential in javascript.

# Process

In this project I created the prompts first to meet the acceptance criteria. Then I created the lower case variable, upper case variable, numeral, and special character variable. 

I used conditional statements such as if and else statements to perform a specific actions, such as the user must enter a number greater or equal to 8 and less than 128  characters to meet the acceptance criteria.

I implemented a for loop so the variable can run over and over with a different variable I included a math.floor and math.random to randomize the password generator

## Conclusion

Javascript is very poweful tool to tell the computer what to do. It enables programmers to create the necessary functions and logic to make the page behave a certain way. There is unlimited potential with Javascript. 

Initially I was very intimidated with this project because I didn't know how to approach the project, but this has also taught me to just code because everyone starts from somewhere.
